	  <h1> The lead up </h1>
	  <p> 
	    About two months ago, Emily, Arthur, Rob and I decided to try something that's been 
	    at the back of our heads since <i> Ian Goodfellow </i> first presented (the awesome) 
	    Generative Adversarial Networks at NIPS last year. Ian's work came close to generating 
	    natural-ish images, but still fell short in terms of image quality. 
	    The paper excited us, and we discussed it to length at the conference and after.
	  </p>
	  <br/>
	  <p class='lead'> Adversarial networks are fun things. </p>
	  <p>
	    You pit a generative (G) machine against a discriminative (G) machine and make them fight. 
	    The G machine attempts to produce fake data that looks so real that the D machine cannot tell it apart. 
	    The D machine is learning to not get fooled by the G machine. 
	    As these both play their mini-max game, you hope to get a good quality generator, 
	    that can generate infinite samples of images that look real.
	  </p>

	    <p>Street Fighter as an analogy for Adversarial Nets. <br/>Two networks fight against each other, 
	      and slowly get better at the game after playing long enough</p>

	  <h1> The research process </h1>
	  <h3> First steps: making Goodfellow's neural network bigger and deeper </h3>
	  <p> To keep this section brief, this did not work. It didn't work at all.
	    The adversarial training was harder to be stable, and when we did get a stable model,
	    it did not improve image sample quality.
	  </p>

	  <h3> Next try: multi-scale generators </h3>
	  <p> The key idea that got us going was to train a laplacian scale of networks, 
	    each network predicting one scale ahead. 

	    What that means in simpler terms is that, the network at a particular scale gets 
	    the coarse-scaled version of the image to predict, and generates the finer-scale version of the image.
	  </p>
	  <div class="thumbnail with-caption">
	    <img src="images/LAPGAN.png"
		 class="img-responsive">
	    <p>Each network Gx generates the difference image, when added to the input image, 
	      gives a finer-scaled image.</p>
	  </div>
	  <h4> The illusion of objectness </h4>
	  <p>
	    The multi-scale generation worked extremely well. It got us to a point where we had samples that looked 
	    much more real than previous attempts at generating such samples. However, there was one problem.
	  </p>
	  <blockquote>
	  <p>
	    The images always looked object-like, but had no actual object.
	  </p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>
	    Looking at the image at a glance would totally wow you, but looking closer, 
	    you'd be scratching your head.

	    This wasn't going as well as we'd hoped, we needed another advance to get us 
	    closer to generating objects that actually were objects.
	  </p>

	  <h3> Finally: Class-conditional, multi-scale generators </h3>
